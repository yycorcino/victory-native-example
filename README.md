## About The Project

This fork of [victory-native-xl](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-native-xl) was created to help me get up and running with the example project quickly and easily.

While exploring the original repository, I noticed that the example project wasn’t running out of the box — it was missing some required dependencies and configuration tweaks.

1. Install npm packages
